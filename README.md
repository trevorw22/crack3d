# crack3d

'crack3d' is my MD5 hash cracker written in Python 2. 
It requires the md5 library which can be installed with pip install md5, or pip3 install md5. 

Here is an example hash for testing:

Here is a website that generates hashes so you can test your own passwords:

You can use any password dictionary file you want to with crack3d as long as it's txt and uses new lines for each password.
